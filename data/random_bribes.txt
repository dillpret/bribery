# Nouns - Random objects or things
A disco ball that plays 80s hits
A talking rubber duck with a British accent
A self-inflating whoopee cushion
A teapot that brews jokes instead of tea
A hat that compliments your hairstyle
A pair of socks that translate dog barks
A pen that corrects spelling but adds puns
A pillow that remembers your dreams
A doorbell that sings opera
A chair that gives life advice
A magic carpet with motion sickness
A teacup that refills with chocolate
A phone that only works upside down
A potted plant that meows
A toaster that burns motivational messages
A magnifying glass that finds lost socks
A book that reads itself aloud
A spoon that tastes better than the food
A thermometer that measures enthusiasm
A watch that tells time in riddles
A briefcase filled with confetti
A watering can that waters itself
A portrait that winks at visitors
A mug that keeps tea at exactly 76.2Â°C
A calculator that only does incorrect maths
A bubble bath that tells fortunes
A spatula that flips pancakes by itself
A bagel with existential wisdom
A bicycle that pedals itself uphill
A scarf that changes pattern based on mood
A tin of biscuits that judges your choice
A puzzle with pieces that reunite overnight
A boot that translates languages
A postcard that updates its picture daily
A snow globe with tiny philosophers
A packet of crisps that never runs out
A mirror that gives honest compliments
A beanbag that remembers your shape
A glove that plays piano
A torch that finds lost arguments
A stapler that sings when it staples
A broom that sweeps to music
A coat that adjusts to weather forecasts
A pair of binoculars that sees through excuses
A kazoo that plays itself
A chocolate fountain filled with wisdom
A pencil that sketches your thoughts
A sieve that separates fact from fiction
A basket that sorts laundry by mood
A lunchbox that adds nutrients to food
