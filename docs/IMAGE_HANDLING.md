# Image and GIF Handling Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to improve image and GIF handling in the Bribery game.

## Issues Addressed

Player feedback indicated several issues with image and GIF submissions:
- Some GIFs weren't playing properly for recipients
- Image or GIF submissions didn't work in certain environments
- Inconsistent rendering across different browsers and devices

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Image Processing

We added a new `image-utils.js` module that provides robust image handling:
- Image validation to ensure only valid images are processed
- Size limits to prevent excessively large images
- Format detection to differentiate between static images and GIFs
- Error handling to provide user feedback when problems occur

### 2. GIF-Specific Handling

- Added specific detection for GIFs using proper MIME type checking
- Preserved animation by using different processing for GIFs vs. static images
- Added CSS classes to optimize GIF display

### 3. Image Optimization

- Added automatic resizing of large images to reduce bandwidth usage
- Implemented quality adjustment for large images to prevent transmission issues
- Added transparent background for GIFs to improve visibility

### 4. Error Recovery

- Added loading state to show when images are being processed
- Improved error messaging when image processing fails
- Graceful fallback when images can't be loaded

### 5. User Experience Improvements

- Added better image containers with proper centering
- Improved aspect ratio handling to prevent distortion
- Added lazy loading for images to improve performance

## Testing

New unit tests have been added to verify:
- Proper GIF detection and handling
- Error handling functionality
- CSS styling for GIFs
- Image optimization and resizing

## Browser Compatibility

These changes should improve compatibility across:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
- Mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- Different network conditions (by reducing file sizes)

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
- Server-side image processing to further reduce client-side requirements
- Image caching to improve performance
- Better mobile camera integration for photo submissions
