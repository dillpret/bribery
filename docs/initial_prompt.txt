I want to make a game that I can host and serve as a webpage. The prime audience is casual players playing this game as an icebreaker etc.
The idea is this:

The game is called "Bribery"

You open the webpage and host or join a game. 
The host should be prompted for their own username and be able to change settings or start the game. 
They should be able to share a link or lobby ID to give to the other players to join. 
Settings include how many rounds to play, and time per round.
Each player should be able to type in their username when they join. 
The lobby should show a list and count of all players joined so that the host knows when everyone is in.

Once the game starts it is split into rounds. 
Each round, each player should be prompted to "bribe" two other players so that each player is also BEING bribed by two other players. 
The point is that each round has a prompt. We need to have an easy way of reading in a random prompt from a list of prompts in a file.
Everyone will see the same prompt such as "A haiku", "A meme", "A gif" (although I'd like to get more specific and creative with these).
The idea is to submit something matching that prompt for each person you're bribing (based on what you think they will like).
You should be able to submit text, images, links, and gifs (for now) ideally with easy copy-paste or drag and drop support on that field.
When the time for the round is up, each person is shown the two bribe submissions from their sending players, without seeing the names of those players.
They will pick which one they like best, and that player's name will be revealed and they will earn a point.
This voting phase should also have a short configurable time limit. When the time is up, points are tallied and a scoreboard is shown before moving on to the next round if there is one.
Each round should have a different random matchup of who is bribing whom, and a different prompt.
When all the rounds are over, there should be a total scoreboard with a special highlight of the podium top 3.
From that end screen the host should be able to restart or go back to the lobby.

This game should be programmed in the simplest stack possible, ideally Python based, with instructions on how to host it in a README.md
The game should be tolerant of people disconnecting and needing to rejoin a match in progress as the same user with the same username.
People should be able to join a game in progress and be shown a waiting screen until the next round starts at which point they are added to the shuffling with a score of 0.
No persistent users or log-ins should be required.
